      <p>Need a standard bit of web hosting? Something all set up for you and you just
      gotta throw your code up there?</p>
      <p>Maybe a bit of SSH, but just a bit? Take a look at these.</p>

      <h1>PaaS Hosting</h1>
      <p>Gotta get that Git-push fancy goodness, with simple addons?</p>
      <p>Heroku started a trend years ago, and now we have a lot of Platform-as-a-Service systems that take minimal effort to get working.</p>

      <h1>Linux Distributions</h1>
      <p>Want to know which Linux distributions come with what versions of PHP?</p>
      <p>Sure, you can upgrade the version, but some folks don't know how, so maybe starting out right is a good move.</p>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <h3>Where do you get the data from?</h3>
    <p>This is a community managed project. People send the versions in <a href="https://github.com/philsturgeon/phpversions.info/tree/gh-pages/_data">via GitHub</a>. We've had a few hosting company employees sending in updates as they deploy them, which is cool.</p>
  <h3>Any plans to automate this?</h3>
    <p>Yeah loads, but for now we still rely on humans.</p>
  <h3>What's up with this design?</h3>
    <p>Phil is pretty good at building APIs, but terrible at design. Please, send help...</p>
  <h3>How do I contribute?</h3>
    <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/philsturgeon/phpversions.info/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing guide on GitHub</a>.</p>
