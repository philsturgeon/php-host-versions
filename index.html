      <p>Want to know which Linux distribution or OS X version come with what version of PHP?</p>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <h3>Where do you get the data from?</h3>
    <p>This is a community managed project. People send the versions in <a href="https://github.com/philsturgeon/phpversions.info">via GitHub</a>. We've had a few hosting company employees sending in updates as they deploy them, which is cool.</p>
  <h3>Any plans to automate this?</h3>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/philsturgeon/phpversions.info/issues/82">Yeah loads</a>, but for now we still rely on humans.</p>
  <h3>How do I contribute?</h3>
    <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/philsturgeon/phpversions.info/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing guide on GitHub</a>.</p>
